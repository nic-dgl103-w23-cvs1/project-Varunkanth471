You will be taught how to prepare your very own handmade stencils which you will then expose onto a screen.  You will screen print using waterbase inks onto paper, completing a small limited edition of 2 colours. After this course you can become an Open Access member or if you rather carry on brushing up your skills and learning new techniques you can join our evening classes.
